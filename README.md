# py(thon)-to-cpp-(unit)-test(ing)

This small library is meant to serve as a starting point for those who write python
code and then convert/optimize it in C++ (or any other language with a related build system,
like CUDA).

It is meant to help you ensure that your optimized C++ code properly reproduces (to your own
tolerance) the results you get from your Python code.
